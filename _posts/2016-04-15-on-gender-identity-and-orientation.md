  So, I may be an anomaly. I don't just write romance with males and females. Or
  romance with two males. Or even romance with two females. I really want to
  write all of them. I want my written universe to have all kinds of people. I
  want trans characters who fall in love. I want characters of all races, all
  sexualities, all orientations to find themselves caught up in my stories.

So, I may be an anomaly. I don't just write romance with males and females. Or romance with two males. Or even romance with two females. I really want to write all of them. I want my written universe to have all kinds of people. I want trans characters who fall in love. I want characters of all races, all sexualities, all orientations to find themselves caught up in my stories.

Because a world with diversity is a world I want to live in. I want a world where anyone, anywhere can fall in love, can live openly in their love. And if we're not quite there in the real world, I can at least write about it.

And maybe because someone is writing about it and someone is reading about it, it might come true.
