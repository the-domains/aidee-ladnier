So I recently reclaimed the rights to my first story with Dr. Forbes Pohle, the lonely roboticist, and his time-traveling lover, Oliver Lennox. As the second story in the Busted Labs series, The Break-in, is still under contract with Dreamspinner Press, I gave them a first chance at republishing it. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eb53d440-1807-4c32-8cfb-54e132d2b41d.jpg)

And they said yes!

--with a caveat.

Dreamspinner asked that I make the short story into a novella. So here I am, revisiting old friends again. It's kind of nice to get back in the head of these characters. They are so obviously meant for each other even if their timing seems a little off.

Of course, there's no Jeepers in this story. The little cat robot hasn't been built yet. But there's a teddy bear robot who is unforgettable. And in this new version, you get to see a character that is only hinted at during The Break-in. 

So cross your fingers for me that I can get this story revised and resubmitted. I'm excited to revisit Forbes and Oliver and I can't wait to show you a little more of their universe!
